My Arduino LED matrix Splatoon style game is a two player territory control game built on a 64 by 32 RGB matrix. Each player moves with a joystick and paints tiles in their color within a small radius around them to claim space and block the other player. Random powerups spawn as obstacles, and collecting one gives a temporary speed boost, while a button activates a special ability that splashes a much larger area on a cooldown. After a timed match, the game counts colored tiles to calculate scores and declares the winner.
